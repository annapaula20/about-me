About Me

Hi My name is Annapaula or Anna for short! After gradauting with a Business degree, I ended up in Human Resources, but I found that it really wasnt something I enjoyed and is defintely not really remote or Pandemic friendly. Now I am currently making a carreer switch to tech for greater work flexability!
